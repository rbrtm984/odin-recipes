        <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>In this dish, a duo of orecchiette pasta and cauliflower is tossed with a light, aromatic butter sauce, which highlights shallot, capers, and red pepper flakes. A sprinkling of garlic-toasted breadcrumbs finishes the dish with delightfully crispy, crunchy contrast.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>6oz Orecchiette Pasta</li>
                <li>1 Lemon</li>
                <li>1 head Cauliflower</li>
                <li>1 clove Garlic</li>
                <li>1/4 cup Sour Cream</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp Hot Sauce</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp Light Brown Sugar</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp Cajun Spice Blend</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp Weeknight Hero Spice Blend</li>
                <li>2 Tbsps Sweet Pickle Relish</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Prepare the ingredients</h3>
                
                    <p>Preheat the oven to 450°F. Wash and dry the fresh produce. Medium dice the potatoes. Snap off and discard the tough, woody stem ends of the asparagus. Quarter and deseed the lemon. In a bowl, combine the Cajun spice blend and sugar.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Roast the potatoes</h3>
                
                    <p>Place the diced potatoes on a sheet pan. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt, pepper, and half the weeknight hero spice blend. Toss to coat and arrange in an even layer. Roast 18 to 22 minutes, or until lightly browned and tender when pierced with a fork. Remove from the oven.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Roast the asparagus and salmon</h3>
                
                    <p>Meanwhile, place the asparagus on a separate sheet pan. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper; toss to coat. Arrange in an even layer on one side of the sheet pan. Pat the fish dry with paper towels; season with salt and pepper on both sides. Transfer to the other side of the sheet pan, skin side down. Top the fish with enough of the Cajun-sugar mixture to coat and a drizzle of olive oil. Roast 10 to 13 minutes, or until the asparagus is tender when pierced with a fork and the fish is browned and cooked through.* Remove from the oven. Evenly top the roasted asparagus with the juice of 2 lemon wedges.

                        *The USDA recommends a minimum safe cooking temperature of 145°F for fish. </p>

                    <h3>Make the dressing and serve your dish</h3>
                
                    <p>Meanwhile, in a bowl, combine the sour cream, hot sauce, remaining weeknight hero spice blend, and relish. Season with salt and pepper. Serve the roasted fish with the roasted potatoes and finished asparagus. Drizzle with the dressing. Serve the remaining lemon wedges on the side. Enjoy!</p>
